Olga Senatov & Aleksei Babykin: Pacman 
Your project is so fun! Nice idea of using the staff pictures on it :D
It is well structured and the code is clean. Good job!
I just wish you had used more the OOP concepts and had added the 2min video.
Besides that is an impressive project to your portfolio.
